# #428 migration — RENAME REGISTRY (canonical old→new mapping)

**Every MANUAL/semantic rename during the XML→JSON migration is logged HERE (owner ruling 2026-06-15).** The
primary purpose is to keep the old↔new mapping **unambiguous for the pass when we update the C++ `readJson`
readers** — a reader must be able to look up exactly which old XML tag a new JSON key came from. A manual rename
must never live only in a curator's head or a single docstring. Add the entity's rows the moment you author its
curator (the cold-modder rule means new names are chosen for clarity, so the old↔new trail is exactly what the
readers pass — and modders/pedia — need).

**Two kinds of rename:**
- **Mechanical de-Hungarianization** (`iGridX`→`gridX`, `bTrade`→`tradeable`, `ArtDefineTag`→`icon`) is applied
  uniformly by `engine.de_i` / `engine.FIELD_RENAME` / `curate_common.{B_FLAG_NAMES,ART_RENAME,AI_BEHAVIOUR}`.
  Those shared maps ARE the documentation for the mechanical class — not re-logged per field here.
- **Semantic / structural renames** (the JSON key means something different, or a field is re-homed to a new
  family/section) are logged per entity below. These are the ones a reader can't infer mechanically.

## GameSpeed  (`curate_gamespeed.py`)

| old XML tag | new JSON path | note |
|---|---|---|
| `iSpeedPercent` | `speed.world.percent` | The master game-pace percentage (Normal=100 → 100%, Eternity=1000 → 1000%). Authored as the single value it is; the engine applies it across costs / durations / growth / culture (engine job, not data). An earlier pass fanned it into `costs`/`growth`/`durations`/`cultureThreshold` members — collapsed (cold-modder ruling). |
| `iUnitYieldScalePercent` | `missionYieldMultiplier.world.percent` | The multiplier (as a %) on yields a unit MISSION produces — a merchant's trade mission boosting another city, a subdued animal slaughtered for food/production (the `<AdaptUnitYield>` channel, ~sqrt of speed; Normal=500, Eternity=1575). Renamed from the non-descriptive `unitYieldScale` (owner, 2026-06-15). |

## Handicap  (`curate_handicap.py`)

⚠ The handicap STRUCTURE needs a future rework (out of scope for #428); the curator docstring is deliberately
verbose about each field's CURRENT meaning so that pass has the full picture. Names below marked PROVISIONAL may
change in the rework. The maintenance/upkeep MEMBER names (`distance`/`numCities`/`unit`/`civic`/… from
`iDistanceMaintenancePercent`/`iUnitUpkeepPercent`/…) are natural field→family.member splits, not re-logged.

| old XML tag | new JSON path | note |
|---|---|---|
| `iAIResearchPercent` | `techCost.empire.ai.percent` | **Manual semantic rename** — AI tech-research COST %. Renamed off `research` so it can't read as the research COMMERCE. PROVISIONAL. |
| `iAITrainPercent` / `iAIWorldTrainPercent` / `iAIConstructPercent` / `iAIWorldConstructPercent` / `iAICreatePercent` / `iAIWorldCreatePercent` | `buildCost.empire.{train,worldTrain,construct,worldConstruct,create,worldCreate}.ai.percent` | AI build-cost % per produced kind, grouped under a new `buildCost` family. PROVISIONAL family name. |
| `iAIPerEraModifier` | `perEra.empire.ai.percent` | META: a per-era ramp on the WHOLE AI-economy family (modifier-of-modifiers). PROVISIONAL — flagged as the least-natural field for the rework. |
| `iAIGrowthPercent` | `growth.empire.ai.percent` | AI city food-to-grow %. PROVISIONAL family name. |
| `iAIWorkRateModifier` | `workRate.empire.ai.percent` | AI worker build-rate %. PROVISIONAL family name. |
| `iHappyBonus` / `iHealthBonus` | `happiness.empire.flat` / `health.empire.flat` | Flat happy/health bonus in every city (dropped the `Bonus` suffix; `happy`→`happiness`). |
| `iMaxColonyMaintenance` | `maintenance.empire.colony.cap` | A hard CAP on the colony-maintenance component, carried as a `cap` member in the family structure (NOT a percent/unit). |
| `iRevolutionIndexPercent` | `revolution.empire.percent` | % into the Revolution index. INCOMPLETE mechanic (WIP, tracked), kept — NOT dead. |
| `iAttitudeChange` | `diplomacy.empire.attitude.flat` | Flat AI diplomatic-attitude shift (applied via the TARGET player's handicap). |
| `iNoTechTradeModifier` / `iTechTradeKnownModifier` | `diplomacy.team.noTechTrade.percent` / `diplomacy.team.techTradeKnown.percent` | Tech-trade availability thresholds (team scope). |
| `iSubdueAnimalBonusAI` | `combat.world.subdueAnimal.ai.percent` | AI subdue-animal odds bonus (game-global → `world`; AI audience). |
| `iFreeWinsVsBarbs` | `combat.empire.freeWinsVsBarbs.flat` | Per-player free combat wins vs barbarians. |
| `iAnimalBonus`/`iAIAnimalBonus`, `iBarbarianBonus`/`iAIBarbarianBonus` | `combat.world.{animal,barbarian}[.ai].percent` | Wildlife/barbarian combat-odds modifiers (game-global; base = vs-human, `ai` = vs-AI). |
| `iGold`, `iStarting{Defense,Worker,Explore}Units` (+ `iAIStarting…`) | `grants[.ai].{startingGold,startingDefenseUnits,startingWorkerUnits,startingExploreUnits}` | One-shot game-start provisioning → `grants` (humans/AIs split via own vs game handicap). |
| `iAdvancedStartPointsMod` / `iAIAdvancedStartPercent` | `identity.advancedStart.{pointsMod,aiPercent}` | Pre-game points-budget mod — NOT a modifier; parked in identity pending an advanced-start review. |
