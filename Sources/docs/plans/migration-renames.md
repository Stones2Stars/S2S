# #428 migration — RENAME REGISTRY (canonical old→new mapping)

**Every MANUAL/semantic rename during the XML→JSON migration is logged HERE (owner ruling 2026-06-15).** The
primary purpose is to keep the old↔new mapping **unambiguous for the pass when we update the C++ `readJson`
readers** — a reader must be able to look up exactly which old XML tag a new JSON key came from. A manual rename
must never live only in a curator's head or a single docstring. Add the entity's rows the moment you author its
curator (the cold-modder rule means new names are chosen for clarity, so the old↔new trail is exactly what the
readers pass — and modders/pedia — need).

**Two kinds of rename:**
- **Mechanical de-Hungarianization** (`iGridX`→`gridX`, `bTrade`→`tradeable`, `ArtDefineTag`→`icon`) is applied
  uniformly by `engine.de_i` / `engine.FIELD_RENAME` / `curate_common.{B_FLAG_NAMES,ART_RENAME,AI_BEHAVIOUR}`.
  Those shared maps ARE the documentation for the mechanical class — not re-logged per field here.
- **Semantic / structural renames** (the JSON key means something different, or a field is re-homed to a new
  family/section) are logged per entity below. These are the ones a reader can't infer mechanically.

## GameSpeed  (`curate_gamespeed.py`)

| old XML tag | new JSON path | note |
|---|---|---|
| `iSpeedPercent` | `speed.world.percent` | The master game-pace percentage (Normal=100 → 100%, Eternity=1000 → 1000%). Authored as the single value it is; the engine applies it across costs / durations / growth / culture (engine job, not data). An earlier pass fanned it into `costs`/`growth`/`durations`/`cultureThreshold` members — collapsed (cold-modder ruling). |
| `iUnitYieldScalePercent` | `missionYieldMultiplier.world.percent` | The multiplier (as a %) on yields a unit MISSION produces — a merchant's trade mission boosting another city, a subdued animal slaughtered for food/production (the `<AdaptUnitYield>` channel, ~sqrt of speed; Normal=500, Eternity=1575). Renamed from the non-descriptive `unitYieldScale` (owner, 2026-06-15). |
