# The interface shape (composability)

> Part of the **[patterns](../patterns.md)** spec.

- A C++03 **interface** = an abstract base class with only pure-virtuals + a virtual dtor and **NO data members**
  (`IEventConsumer` is the realized model).
- **MI as `implements`:** one concrete satisfies several role-contracts via MI of their stateless interface bases —
  the compose-roles axis, **NOT** a DI substitute.
- **Two guardrails:** (1) MI **only** of stateless pure-virtual bases — MI of stateful concretes invites the
  diamond / layout / virtual-base mess; (2) graft interfaces onto the **DLL-internal derived** classes
  (`CvCityAI`/`CvUnitAI`), **never** onto EXE-bound bases (`CvCity`/`CvUnit` — the closed `.exe` binds their
  vtable/layout). The derived side is the safe lane and the lever for shrinking the god-classes.
- **Isolate-systems recipe:** when two systems entangle, give each its own data block + predicate query-surface,
  have both implement the one shared contract, and switch at the composition root. (Worked example: simple traits vs
  complex/Thunderbrd traits.)
